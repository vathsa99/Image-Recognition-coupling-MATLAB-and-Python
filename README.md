# Image-Recognition-coupling-MATLAB-and-Python

In the fields of computer vision and pattern recognition, handwritten numeral identification is a captivating area of study.This project explores the integration of MATLAB and Python for image recognition tasks. By combining the strengths of MATLAB’s image processing capabilities with Python’s extensive libraries for machine learning and deep learning, we aim to create a flexible image recognition system.This report suggests a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based network is efficient method for handwritten numeral identification. The suggested solution uses CNN as a feature extractor after normalizing the input image with a single digit. Due to its great accuracy, convolutional neural networks based on deep learning find extensive use in the recognition of many objects these days. CNNs have been experimented on a large, MNIST dataset which is a widely used benchmark dataset in this domain, consisting of 28*28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The results obtained show that the accuracy was observed to be 98.314 percent
